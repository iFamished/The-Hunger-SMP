## **What is The Hunger SMP?**
The Hunger SMP is a Vanilla+ Minecraft server created by owner iFamished and former owner foamyWaffles. The server is designed to be a family-friendly place to play Minecraft with other people in a safe enviroment. The SMP started out as a Hypixel SMP with a few friends, then moved to an Aternos server, and now to a locally hosted server on my computer. The Hunger SMP is up 24/7. The server's mods and datapacks are all fully server-side - meaning you don't have to install **any** mods whatsoever! You can use OptiFine, your favorite modpack, or just the official launcher without missing out on any features.
